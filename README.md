### \<a name="project-ethos"\>\</a\> Project Ethos: The Autonomous Wanderer

G.I.S.M.O. is the archetype of the **Autonomous Wanderer**. Its purpose is to navigate and perceive its environment, learning from its surroundings and making its own decisions. This project is a testament to the power of modular code design and the potential of a mobile platform to become self-aware through a network of sensors.

-----

### \<a name="what-youll-need"\>\</a\> What You'll Need

This project is intended for builders with an intermediate skill level in electronics and programming. To complete the core build, you will need to acquire the following:

* **Parts List**: The definitive list of all components and wiring can be found in the `pi zero 2w Components and GPIO Assignments.txt` and `wiring_colours.txt` files.
* **Essential Tools**:
  * Raspberry Pi (Zero 2W or similar)
  * Soldering Iron & Solder
  * Breadboard and Jumper Wires
  * L298N Motor Driver
  * HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
  * 2 Edge Detection Sensors
* **Skill Level**: This project is suitable for intermediate builders with a basic understanding of Python, Linux (Raspberry Pi OS), and electronics.
* **Core Code**: The basic test scripts and foundational modules are provided in this repository.

-----

### \<a name="core-blueprint"\>\</a\> Explore the Core Blueprint

This repository contains the foundational code and documentation needed to build G.I.S.M.O. and execute its most basic rituals. The files here will help you understand motor control, sensor functionality, and initial setup.

* **`config/config.py`**: A central configuration file that defines pin assignments and hardware parameters.
* **`tests/`**: Contains simple test scripts for individual components like the buzzer, motors, and sensors.
* **`lib/`**: Includes foundational library files and reference images, such as the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W pinout.

-----

### \<a name="glimpse-of-ritual"\>\</a\> A Glimpse into the Build Ritual

The true journey of G.I.S.M.O. involves moving from basic functionality to true autonomy. This process is documented in a series of rituals designed to grant the robot advanced capabilities.

* **Basic Movement Ritual**: Calibrate the motors and servos to perform fundamental movements and arm gestures.
* **Sensor Awakening Ritual**: Test and integrate a variety of sensors, including ultrasonic, sound, and touch sensors, to allow G.I.S.M.O. to perceive its immediate environment.
* **Wandering Ritual**: Combine sensor data with basic logic to allow G.I.S.M.O. to wander autonomously while avoiding obstacles and edges.

-----

### \<a name="full-ritual"\>\</a\> Embark on the Full Ritual

To unlock G.I.S.M.O.'s full potential as an Autonomous Wanderer, you need the complete Praximous Codex. The premium roadmap contains:

* **Advanced Navigation Algorithms**: Detailed guides on implementing dead reckoning, occupancy grid mapping, and self-righting logic.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: In-depth tutorials, code examples, and full schematics for every subsystem.
* **The Full Lore**: The complete story behind G.I.S.M.O.'s archetype and its place in the Praximous universe.
