# **Project-G.I.S.M.O**  
_A Mobile Robotics Platform Built on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W_

## **Overview**  
Project-G.I.S.M.O (Guided Intelligent System for Mobile Operations) is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W-based mobile robot designed to demonstrate key robotics concepts, such as navigation, obstacle avoidance, and pathfinding. This project highlights the integration of hardware and software to create an autonomous, adaptable, and efficient robot.

## **Project Origin Story**  
G.I.S.M.O is more than just a robot—it’s a culmination of curiosity, learning, and technical growth. When I embarked on this journey, there wasn’t a clear goal in mind. I simply wanted to take my Python programming skills beyond interactive programs and challenge myself to create something physical, something real—a robot that could interact with the world around it.

This was my first attempt at robotics, and as I began experimenting, things started to click. The project grew organically, expanding as I discovered new concepts and techniques. Features like **dead reckoning** and **adaptive navigation** weren’t planned from the start—they emerged as I gained a deeper understanding of robotics and coding. With each milestone, G.I.S.M.O transformed into a platform that showcases the power of hands-on learning and innovation.

Building G.I.S.M.O has been an incredible experience, one that reflects my approach to problem-solving: dive in, experiment, adapt, and refine. It’s messy, exciting, and immensely rewarding—a true labor of love.
